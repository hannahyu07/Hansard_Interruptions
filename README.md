# Silenced in the Chamber: Analyzing Gendered Speech Interruptions in the Australian Parliament (1998â€“2022)

## Overview

This repo explores interruptions in the Australian Parliament from 1998 to 2022, examining whether female members are more frequently interrupted than males during debates. By analyzing Hansard records, the study quantifies interjections and assesses factors like speech length, speaker's party affiliation, and governing status. These elements help understand if interruptions are influenced by gender or political dynamics, aiming to identify gender biases and influence parliamentary reform for better decorum and equality.

## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data/raw_data` contains the raw data as obtained from the Hansard Records.
-   `data/analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `model` contains fitted models. 
-   `other` contains relevant literature, details about LLM chat interactions, and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.


## Statement on LLM usage

Aspects of the code and paper were written with the help of ChatGPT. Some of the data interpretation, introduction, abstract and discussion were also written using ChatGPT. The entire chat history is available in `inputs/llms/usage.txt`
